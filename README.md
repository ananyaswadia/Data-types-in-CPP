# Data-types-in-CPP
A discussion on the basic data types C++ has to offer.

Aim: To learn and implement data types in C++.
Tool: V S Code or any IDE.
Theory: 
🔹 int (Integer)
Stores whole numbers (no decimals)
Example: int age = 20;

🔹 char (Character)
Stores a single character
Enclosed in single quotes ('A', '5')
Example: char grade = 'A';

🔹 double
Stores decimal numbers with double precision (more accurate than float)
Example: double pi = 3.14159;

🔹 string
Stores a sequence of characters (words or sentences)
Requires #include <string>
Example: string name = "Ananya";

🔹 float
Stores decimal numbers with single precision
Less accurate than double, uses less memory
Example: float temp = 36.6f; (note the f)

🔹 bool (Boolean)
Stores true or false
Used in conditions and logic



Conclusion: We learnt about the basic data types supported by C++ and how to use them .

Example: bool isPassed = true;
