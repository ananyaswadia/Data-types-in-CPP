# Data-types-in-CPP
A discussion on the basic data types C++ has to offer.

## Aim
To learn and implement data types in C++.

## Tools
V S Code or any IDE.

## Theory

### int (Integer)-
Stores whole numbers (no decimals)
Example: int age = 20;

 ### char (Character)
Stores a single character
Enclosed in single quotes ('A', '5')
Example: char grade = 'A';

### double
Stores decimal numbers with double precision (more accurate than float)
Example: double pi = 3.14159;

### string
Stores a sequence of characters (words or sentences)
Requires #include <string>
Example: string name = "Ananya";

### float
Stores decimal numbers with single precision
Less accurate than double, uses less memory
Example: float temp = 36.6f; (note the f)

### bool (Boolean)
Stores true or false
Used in conditions and logic
Example: bool isPassed = true;


## Conclusion
We learnt about the basic data types supported by C++ and how to use them .
